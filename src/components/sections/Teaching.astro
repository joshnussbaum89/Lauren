    <p>My work as an educator is intimately related to my work as a researcher.</p>
    <p>

        I work to illuminate the genius and ingenuity of (young) learners through the pedagogy and
        design of robust, embodied learning environments. I echo Rose's ethos that people make
        sense, and thus I work with an ethical analytic and pedagogical responsibility to honor the
        sensibility in learners' sensemaking. Preserving learners' dignity is of the utmost
        importance as learning is an extremely vulnerable process of humanization. I bring
        enthusiasm, humor, and care to my pedagogical sensibilities, as I have learned from
        educators that I admire and participants in my research that enthusiasm is infectious, humor
        can be relaxing, and care is the essence of all good teaching.

        or a pre-service teacher sharing observations of learning in context, my pedagogical role is
        to make sense of their thinking, highlight the generative aspects of it, and push towards
        more expansive ends. As one graduate student shared in an evaluation of my teaching,
        “Lauren's greatest strength is in the ways that she highlights the unique and interesting
        pieces of each person's contribution. This is far from simple complimenting, but rather, a
        way to emphasize the brilliance in what everyone is able to contribute in class, and weave
        them together in a coherent story.”</span

    <p>As an educator, I see my role as an ambassador of the Learning Sciences as a field.</p>

        Thus, my primary teaching goal is for students to thoughtfully connect theory to their
        design and pedagogical decisions so that their sensemaking is guided by conceptualizations
        of how learning happens. I want students to reflect on the socially and interactionally
        complex nature of learning as an aesthetic, emotional, ethical, and political experience.
        Across my teaching experiences at Vanderbilt, from an undergraduate course on the design of
        informal learning environments to an advanced graduate methods course on Interaction
        Analysis, I have asked students to engage in close descriptive observations of learning in
        context. While this entails pushing students to put theories of learning into action in
        their own descriptive analyses, it also involves explicitly engaging students in examining
        how issues of equity and power are at play in learning environments. In my research, I have
        seen how even the most expansive pedagogies can be limited by deficit ideologies of race,
        class, and gender, (Sengupta-Irving, Vogelstein, Brady, & Phillips-Galloway, accepted with
        major revisions JLS). Thus, I explicitly attend to ideologies and limiting assumptions in my
        own teaching in order to push students to consider these same tensions in their own
        conceptualizations of learning and design.</span
